# SnowNmap
Nice little python script that uses nmap to find all mac addresses associated with Raspberry Pi's 


## Run 
  In the root directory run:
  ```python 
      sudo python main.py
  ```

## Results 
  You should see something printed out like this:
  ```
     IP found for interface en4
     No IP found for interface utun1
     ['B8:27:EB:XX:XX:XX', '10.10.1.45', 'raspberrypi.mydomain.com']
  ```
